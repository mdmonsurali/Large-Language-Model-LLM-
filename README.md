ü§ñ LLM Tutorials and RAG Implementations

Welcome to the LLM Tutorials and RAG Implementations repository! This repository provides tutorials, guides, and implementations for working with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 3, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, Mistral, and more, using frameworks like Ollama and GPT4All. It also includes examples of advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches, such as Raptor, GraphRAG, and R2R (RAG to Riches), integrated with vector databases like ChromaDB and FIAS.

üöÄ Overview

This repository is designed to help developers and researchers work with cutting-edge LLMs and RAG methodologies. You'll find:

Model tutorials: Learn how to load and use models like Llama 3, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Mistral using Ollama and GPT4All frameworks.
RAG approaches: Implement and explore RAG techniques such as Raptor, GraphRAG, and R2R to enhance LLM capabilities with context-aware information retrieval.
Vector databases: Tutorials on integrating vector databases like ChromaDB and FIAS for efficient data retrieval and similarity searches.
